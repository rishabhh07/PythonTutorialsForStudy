# My Library

# Question given in video :
"""
Q-:You have to create a library management System . This must be done by creating a class called library

The class library should have the following functions:
1)display book: It displays all the books in the library along with wether they are available or lent to someone
2)lend book: This will allow the user to issue a book from the library. If the requested book is lent to someone
             then print their name
3)add book: This fn is used to enter the name of the book to be added to the lib
4)return book : Allows the user to return a book

The Constructor of the class should take 2 arguments:
1) a list of all the book in the lib
2) the name of the lib

E.g:
HarryLibrary = Library(listofbooks, library_name)

You are to keep record of which book is issued to who via a dict as follows:
key - name of the book
value - name of the person issued to
dictionary (books-nameofperson)

create a main function and run an infinite while loop asking
users for their input"""
